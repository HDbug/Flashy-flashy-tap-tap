**Create front end ui first to get issues sorted before hand.**


* With front end up make sure to add a buttom bar menu similar to spotify and youtube


**Create button that turns flashlight on and off first to makesure needed code is there.**

* Flash light will have to have a timer of around 1.5 - 2 seconds so that it is actually visable when used

**Create p2p network service that preferably uses a password based system to make it easier on users <3**


* Make sure this p2p network workds correctly and if an error occurs it retries rather than just crash
